- Request samples: Ask for samples of the products you want to sell to ensure that they meet your quality and performance standards.

- Communicate your expectations: Communicate your expectations upfront to manage your supplier's and your own expectations. This may include pricing, minimum order quantities, deadlines, and other details.

By following these tips, you'll be better equipped to find reliable suppliers that suit your business needs. Remember, building a strong supplier relationship takes time, patience, and excellent communication skills.
