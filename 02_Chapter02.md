# Chapter 2: Choosing the Right Products to Sell

Welcome back to our comprehensive guide on How to do dropshipping correctly. In our last chapter, we gave you an introduction to dropshipping, an online retail method where a store does not keep the products it sells in stock. Instead, when a store sells a product using the dropshipping method, it purchases the item from a third party and has it shipped directly to the customer. We hope you found our previous chapter insightful and are now ready to dive deeper into the world of dropshipping.

In this chapter, we'll focus on one of the most critical aspects of dropshipping - choosing the right products to sell. As a dropshipper, your profitability depends on the products you offer, so it's crucial to choose the right items that your customers want. Failure to do so can result in your online store's failure, and no one wants that. But don't worry- in this chapter, we've got you covered.

We're excited to have Neil Patel as our special guest in this chapter. Neil Patel is a renowned digital marketing expert and the founder of companies such as Crazy Egg, Hello Bar, and KISSmetrics.

So, whether you're a beginner or a seasoned dropshipper, this chapter has something for everyone. Get ready to dive in and transform your dropshipping business!
