# Introduction to Dropshipping

Welcome to the first chapter in our comprehensive guide on How to do dropshipping correctly. In this chapter, we will explore the concept of dropshipping, its history, and the advantages and disadvantages of this e-commerce business model. We are also joined by our special guest, Richard Lazazzera, who will share his valuable insights and experience in dropshipping.

## What is dropshipping?

Dropshipping is an e-commerce business model where the retailer doesn't hold the inventory but instead forwards the orders to their supplier, who then ships the products directly to the customer. In a dropshipping model, the retailer acts as the middleman between the customer and the supplier, enabling them to sell products without having to manage inventory or handle the shipping process.

## A brief history of dropshipping

Dropshipping has been around for a long time but has seen a surge in popularity in recent years due to the rise of e-commerce. The origins of dropshipping can be traced back to the mail-order catalog industry in the early 1900s, where retailers would offer products for sale without keeping them in stock. However, the modern dropshipping model emerged with the widespread availability of the internet and e-commerce platforms.

## Advantages and disadvantages of dropshipping

Dropshipping offers several benefits to e-commerce retailers, including:

- Low startup costs: Since retailers don't have to purchase inventory upfront, they can start their business with minimal capital.
- Easy to scale up: Dropshipping enables retailers to sell a wide range of products without worrying about the logistical complexities of managing inventory and shipping.
- Location independence: Retailers can operate their dropshipping business from anywhere in the world with an internet connection.

However, dropshipping also has several drawbacks, including:

- Low-profit margins: Since the retailer doesn't purchase inventory upfront, their profit margins are usually lower than traditional retail.
- Limited control: Retailers have little control over the fulfillment process, which can lead to issues with the quality of the product and shipping times.
- Competition: Dropshipping has a relatively low barrier to entry, which can lead to a crowded market and intense competition.
